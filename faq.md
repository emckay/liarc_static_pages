#### What is LIARC?

LIARC is a real company. LIARC is a game, an experiment, and an art project.

Inspired by market-based decision making (see [Futarchy](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html)), variable rules games (see [Nomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic)), and recent successes in crowd governance (see [Twitch Plays Pokemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon)) LIARC takes all its actions based on the wisdom of the crowd aggregated by decision markets.

In its initial form, LIARC is a real company with no revenue, no products, and no way even to develop products. At the moment, LIARC only has a basic accounting system and a framework for making decisions. To succeed, LIARC will need market participants to fill in the blanks.

#### How do I participate in LIARC?

The first step to participating in LIARC is to create an account and purchase **pseudo-cash**. One unit of pseudo-cash can be purchased for 0.01 USD (plus transaction fees). Pseudo-cash allows users to purchase **pseudo-shares**.

There is no way to convert pseudo-cash to USD. LIARC would have to address legal concerns before this is possible. LIARC's pseudo-cash should be thought of as an in-game virtual currency that has no real-world value. LIARC is not liable to repay pseudo-currency under any circumstances.

In the form of pseudo-cash, LIARC pays out all of its net income each month to holders of pseudo-shares. On the first day of every month, each pseudo-share pays out `1/N * Monthly Net Income` to each shareholder, where `N` is the total number of shares outstanding.

Any user can purchase pseudo-shares with pseudo-cash in the pseudo-share market.

#### What are potential pseudo-shares and potential pseudo-cash?

Users can also purchase **potential pseudo-shares** (PPS) with **potential pseudo-cash** (PPC). PPS and PPC convert into their non-potential (actual) counterparts when certain trigger conditions are met. Each class of PPS/PPC also has an end date. If the end date is reached and the trigger conditions haven't been fulfilled, the PPS/PPC are canceled and the holders are in the same position  they would have been if they had never bought or sold PPS.

LIARC's decision markets are markets to exchange PPS and PPC with trigger conditions that require LIARC to adopt new policies, amend existing policies, or take one-time actions. An example of the trigger condition for a PPS/PPC class is: "This PPS/PPC converts if LIARC changes its name to Feels Good Inc. before Jan 1 next year."

Good trigger conditions meet the following criteria:

1. They are specific enough so that there is no room for disagreement on whether they have been met.
2. Required actions are specific and small enough that LIARC employees can accomplish them with the limited resources at their disposal. For example, "LIARC should sell an iPhone app that locates the nearest public restroom" is too large of an action. "LIARC should solicit quotes from X, Y, and Z freelance agencies to develop a public-restroom directory app" is sufficiently specific.
3. They do not require the company to do something illegal or immoral.

Any user can create a PPS/PPC market with any set of trigger conditions. Moderators may remove markets and cancel PPS/PPC for any reason but will try not to do so unless the trigger conditions do not meet the above criteria.

#### How does LIARC makes decisions?

The price of potential pseudo-shares relative to the price of actual pseudo-shares offers insight into the market's view on whether the proposed policy will be beneficial or harmful to LIARC. If the price of a PPS is much lower than the price of actual pseudo-shares, then the market believes that adopting the policy to trigger the PPS will result in less net income.

LIARC will attempt to implement all policies proposed by PPS that trade at prices above the price of pseudo-shares. If proposed policies conflict, LIARC will implement the policy with the highest price.
