# LIARC

## Introduction

LIARC is a real company.

LIARC does not do anything. LIARC has no customers and no strategy to acquire customers. In fact, LIARC has no product to sell nor any services to offer. LIARC's only asset is a website that allows anyone to help it make decisions.

All that is subject to change.

LIARC's goal is to discover how effectively the wisdom of the crowd can be applied to corporate governance and management decisions. To transform the wisdom of the crowds into actionable directives, LIARC implements an information aggregation technique first described by [Robin Hanson](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/): **decision markets**.

## Decision Markets

When choosing a method to aggregate information, many people call for a vote. While the level playing field created by voting is appealing when designing a political system, democracy may not be the best way to make management decisions. Democracy's demand for equal representation does not allow the opinion of experts to outweigh the opinion of the uninformed. Furthermore, voters have little incentive to research carefully and choose the right decision. 

Decision markets offer an alternative that mitigates these downsides by requiring participants in the decision making process to bet on the outcome of a proposed policy. For more background on decision markets, please read the writings of Robin Hanson on [decision markets](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/decisionmarkets.pdf) and [futarchy](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy2013.pdf).

LIARC tries to make all its management decisions based on the results of decision markets. LIARC's decision markets allow users to spend **pseudo-cash** to purchase **pseudo-shares**. Pseudo-cash is a virtual currency that can be purchased with USD. Pseudo-shares pay their holders a portion of LIARC's net income every month. Pseudo-share payments are made in pseudo-cash.

For a detailed example of how LIARC could use a decision market to decide to replace its administrator, [click here](/decision_market_example).

## LIARC's current situation

LIARC has a set of policies that describe the function of the website and can also serve as directives to its employees. These can be thought of as instructions a manager gives to a junior employee -- they don't need to be as specific as code written for a computer, but should be specific enough that it is clear how to implement them.

LIARC's current [policies](/policies) detail user accounts, the accounting procedure used to calculate monthly net income, and the mechanics of decision markets.

Under the current policies, LIARC generates no net income, does not penalize users for insolvency, has no way to amortize costs, has no way to allocate limited time or money among various projects, has no mechanism to split shares, and has many other shortcomings.

LIARC has one employee, Eric McKay, who acts as the sole administrator and moderator. The website was coded quickly, so there are possibly bugs, and there will certainly be performance issues as then number of users grows.

There are `1,000,000` pseudo-shares outstanding. LIARC has a USD cash balance of `5,000 USD`, and a PC balance of `-500,000 PC`. The cash balance is the result of a sale of `10%` of the pseudo-shares for `5,000 USD` to Eric.

Every day, starting on **LAUNCH DATE**, LIARC will issue a limit order selling `1,000 PS` at `50 PC` per share at `00:00:00 UTC`. This will continue every day until LIARC is left with `75%` of the total shares outstanding.
